Hi, I’m Matt! 👋
Thanks for checking out my GitHub.

I completed the Web Development Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs (Nov 2021 – Feb 2022), where I developed a strong foundation in full-stack development. Since June 2022, I've been working as a Fullstack Web Developer at Equinox Engineering, building and maintaining impactful web applications.

Most recently, I built Etude — a minimalist classical music radio that streams curated pieces around the clock. It’s a passion project that blends clean design with a love for timeless music. [Etude](https://viewetude.netlify.app)

NeighbourGuessr is a location-guessing web game inspired by GeoGuessr, but designed specifically for Calgarians. Players are dropped into a random Google Street View location within Calgary and try to guess where they are on the map.
